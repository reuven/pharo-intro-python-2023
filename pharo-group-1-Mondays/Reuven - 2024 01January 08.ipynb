    "- When we iterate over a `range`, we get integers -- `range(5)` will give us 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4\n",
    "- We even saw a little bit of `enumerate`, which gives us the index as well as the element when we iterate\n",

    "for index, one_character in enumerate('abcd'):  # we get two items with each iteration!\n",

    "The basic idea in a `for` loop is that there is some sequence of values, and we want to execute the loop body on each value in that sequence.\n",

    "But there are also many cases in which we want to repeat our code, but we don't have a sequence to repeat on. That's because we don't know in advance how many times we're going to need to iterate.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where `while` loops come in. They will run as many (or few) times as needed to achieve a certain goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of `while` as kind of like `if` -- there is a condition, and if the condition is `True`, then the body executes. The difference between `while` and `if` is that `if` executes its body *once*. By contrast, `while` executes its body once, then goes back and checks the condition -- and if the condition is still `True`, then we execute it again. And again. And again. Each time, we check the condition."
